== Search ==

Basically you can search Topic Types and identifiers. The results are displayed as tree structure in a new view. 
The root shows informations about the specific search (type, search string e.g.) and the children represent the results.
The button above the tree refreshes the last search. All searches are reachable by the menu entry *Search*.

TIP: Double click on any entry to open its Property page.  

_Onotoa_ provides several different searches for different purposes. These are:

* Search Topic Type
* List Topics without Identifier
* List All Subject Identifier 
* List All Subject Locator 
* Find Use
* Clean Schema

=== Search Topic Type ===

This is a search for any Topic Type of the schema. Access this search via *Search->Search Topic Type* at the menu. You can refine the search by the use of some constraints. These are:   

* *Search String:* A string the topic name or one identifier should match. If this field is empty,
all topics are a possible result.  
* *Type:* Set the target type of the searched topic. Possible types are: *Topic Type*, *Occurrence Type*, 
*Name Type*, *Role Type* and *Association Type*. The default value *Any* which means that the type constraint is disabled. 
* *Case sensitive:* If this option is enabled lower and upper cases of your search string are respected by the 
string matching.
* *Exact Match:* This means only strings that are exactly the same (case insensitive) are recognized as match.
* *Regular Expression:* By the use of the option, the search string will be interpreted as a regular expression. 
If you enable this one, the options *Case sensitive* and *Exact Match* will be automatically disabled.
* *Check Name:* Compares the topics name with the search string.
* *Check Subject Identifier:* Compares the topics _Subject Identifiers_ with the search string.
* *Check Subject Locator:* Compares the topics _Subject Locators_ with the search string.     

NOTE: _Check Name_, _Check Subject Identifier_ and _Check Subject Locator_ are connected as logical disjunction.

At this mode you can define constraints the searched type should use. The left list shows all available Topic Types. 
Select one or more entry and click the image:images/documentation/search/buttons/add_one.png[] button to add them or double 
click on one entry. Your selection should appear in the right list. Remove them by double clicking or the use of the

=== Clean Schema ===

_Onotoa_  offers this little feature to keep your schema clean. Open the cleaner via *Search->Clean Schema* t the menu. It 
searches unused Topic Types and provides the opportunity to delete them. If the list is empty, everything seems to be fine. 
Above the list is a text field, that you can use to filter (case sensitive) the results.

Depending on its type, a topic is recognized as unused when:

* *Topic Type* is never used as role and plays no role. It also haven't at least one identifier or constraint, isn't
part of any *isa* or *ako* relation and is never used as scope.

* *Occurrence Type* is never used as occurrence constraint.
* *Name Type* is never used as name constraint.
* *Role Type* is never set as role for any Association Type.
* *Association Type* is never type of at least one association constraint.
