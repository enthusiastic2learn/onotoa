== Property Details View ==

Every element of an schema has a property page in which the properties of an element may be changed. 
Examples for properties are the name of a topic type or the cardinality of a constraint. The following
sections will present the property pages of the elements. These pages are rendered in the *Property Details View*.

NOTE: The property pages support undo and redo for model changes. To omit a lot of changes during entering
the text, _Onotoa_ performs the changes when the text field loses its focus.
