== The Property Details View ==

Every element of an schema has a property page where the properties of an element may be changed. 
Examples for properties are the name of a topic type or the cardinality of a constraint. The following
sections will explain the property pages of the elements. These pages are shown in the *Property Details View*.
The view a property page of an element, you will have to select it either in the *Model View* or in a *Diagram Editor*.

NOTE: The property pages support undo and redo functions for model changes. To manage a lot of changes during entering the text, 
_Onotoa_ processes the changes after the text field loses its focus or the enter key was pressed.
