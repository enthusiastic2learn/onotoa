=== Using the standalone version of _Onotoa_ ===

After downloading the file zip file for your system and unzipping it you should have
a *onotoa* folder. This includes a binary file (e.g. onotoa.exe for Windows(TM) or Onotoa.app on MacOS(TM)).

After starting _Onotoa_ you should see the main window, like in <<empty_win>>.

To create a new model, use the *File->New..*.
Choose the path of the file and name it *example.ono*. After that your window should look like <<emptyfile_win>>

=== Using the plugin version of _Onotoa_ ===

After installing the needed _Onotoa_ features, create a new file. Use the context menu entry *New*, choose *Other* and select 
*New Onotoa File* in the category *Onotoa*. 

NOTE: You need a project, where you create the file. The nature of the project doesn't matter.

After creating the new file _Onotoa_ switches to the *Onotoa Perspective*. This should look like <<nonrcp_win>>.

=== Creating the first diagram ===

With _Onotoa_ it is possible to create multiple diagrams for a Topic Maps schemas. Although it is possible to create the schema using wizards provided
by the *Model View* it is advised to create the schema using the diagrams.

Vie the context menu of the 'Diagrams' node in the *Model View* a new diagram can be created. After selecting *New Diagram* a dialog asks for the name of the
diagram. This name should be unique inside one schema definition. After pressing okay, the diagram is added to the 'Diagrams' node and an editor opens where the
diagram can be edited.

At the right side of the editor is a sidebar. This sidebar is called a palette and contains the tools to create new diagram elements (see <<palette>>).

Two add a new element to the diagram just drag an palette entry into the position in the diagram.

NOTE: Not every element is a diagram element. For example, to create a new occurrence constraint you need an existing topic type and drop the palette entry in
this topic type.

TIP: Instead of Drag and Drop elements of the palette, it is possible to click on them and click on the target point in the diagram. A new element 
is created after the second click.

Now you should be able to create some topic types and set them in a type-instance relationship.

The following section will explain how to edit the properties of a topic type.
