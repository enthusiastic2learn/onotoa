Getting started
---------------


=== Using the standalone version of _Onotoa_ ===


After downloading the file zip file for your system and unzipping it you should have
a *onotoa* folder. This includes a binary file (e.g. onotoa.exe for Windows™ or Onotoa.app on MacOS™).

After starting _Onotoa_ you should see the main window, like in Figure 1.

To create a new model, use the *File->New..*.
Choose the path of the file and name it *example.ono*. After that your window should look like Figure 2

=== Using the plugin version of _Onotoa_ ===

After installing the needed _Onotoa_ features, create a new file. Use the context menu entry *New*, choose *Other* and select 
*New Onotoa File* in the category *Onotoa*. 

NOTE: You need a project, where you create the file. The nature of the project doesn't matter.

After creating the new file _Onotoa_ switches to the *Onotoa Perpective*. This should look like Figure 3.

=== Creating the first diagram ===

With _Onotoa_ it is possible to create multiple diagrams for a Topic Maps schemas. Although it is possible to create the schema using wizards provided
by the *Model View* it is advised to create the schema using the diagrams.
