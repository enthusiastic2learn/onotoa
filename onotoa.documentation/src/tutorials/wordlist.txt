== How to use the word list editor ==

=== Theoretical background ===  

Sometimes the initial step to specify a domain is to collect a set of words which are part of the domain. _Onotoa_ provides an editor to 
collect the words. The goal of the editor is to create types which use the words as name. Therefore every words needs an assigned topic type.
After that the creation of the types is just a click on a button.

In the second column you can assign types to your words. The topics maps that will be
created from your words will have this type. Just click into the table cell and a combo box will be activated to 
choose the type. To comment the word just click into the third column of the row. Words can be modified by clicking in the 
first column. 

NOTE: You may not enter a word twice even if it should have different types.


Use the check boxes to select words you want to create a type of or remove. 

After setting the types for the words you can create the types by pressing the *Create Type* button.
You will find the new types in the *ModelView* like in the image below.
