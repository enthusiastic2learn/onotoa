== How to use the reifier constraint ==

=== Theoretical background ===  

We use reifiers to provide additional informations for a topic and distinguish between reifyable topics and topics, that reifies another 
topic (only topic types can do this). Reifyable topics are:

* *Occurrence Types*
* *Name Types*
* *Associations Types*

Once the constraint is used to make a topic reifyable, there are three possible settings for the reifyable topic:

* topic *can not* have a reifier -> cardinality [0..0]
* topic *may* have a reifier -> cardinality [0..1]
* topic *must* have a reifier -> cardinality [1..1]

To demonstrate the constraint, we will create the following short example:

A company has got a homepage and we want to specify the information who created this homepage. To simplify matters we define that a person created it.
So we need a topic "company" her reifyable occurrence "homepage" and a second topic "person" which is the refier. Let us get into _Onotoa_.

=== Into Onotoa ===

First of all, we have to create an new model and a new diagram. Click on *File->New* and choose your preferred name 
for the model, e.g. "example_reifier.ono". To create a new diagram, right click on *Diagram* in the *Model View* and choose
 *Create New Diagram...* in the context menu.
After your decision for a diagram name, the _Onotoa_ window should looks like this:  

.Onotoa 
[[ref_create_model_diagram]]

Let us start with the reifier topic. Open the context of the node *TopicTypes* in the *Model View* at the right hand side of the _Onotoa_ window and choose 
*Create TopicType...* . Type "person" in the following dialogue to finish our first topic. Create the "company" topic in the same way. 

.Create Topic Type
[[ref_create_topic_type]]

As we can see the topics do not appears in the editor window. Click on the triangle on the left hand side of the *TopicType* node to list all 
topics and add the existing ones to the editor by drag and drop. Your editor window should looks like this one:

.Editor View
[[ref_editor_view_1]]

As next step we will create the occurrence "homepage". Therefore right click on the "company" topic and select the entry *Add Occurrence Constraint* 
in the context menu. Now we must create and set the specific Occurrence Type. Create a new one by the use of the *Model View* and name it "homepage". 
Switch to the property page of the Occurrence Constraint and click on the image:images/select_icon.png[] button at the left hand side to set the type. A list of all available 
types appears and we choose our only existing one: "homepage". 

Now we take hand on the reifier constraint. All necessary settings can be done in the *Property Details View*. We start with the topic "person" and wanted to set 
the topic this one will reifies. Click on the graphical representation to get access to its property page and scroll down to the section *reifies*. Click on 
the add button and _Onotoa_ provides all possible topics in a list. Select "homepage" and confirm your choice.

The final step will be to define that
