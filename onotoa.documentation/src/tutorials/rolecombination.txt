=== Theoretical background === 

With the help of the _role_ _combination_ _constraint_ we are able to avoid unnecessary variations of players and roles.

A common example to figure this constraint out is a transitive association like "contains". Transitive means: If _a_ contains _b_ and _b_ contains _c_, _a_ automatically contains _c_, which is not necessary to specify. 
According to this, we will create a simple example with the three players "state", "country" and "city" and our association "contains".

Obviously we recognize the top bottom relationship. A state may contains countries and a country may contains cities.
Other combinations (like a state may contains cities) are not allowed and through the transitive character of the association dispensable.

So all we need to create a topic map schema is:

* *Association Type:* Contains

* *Topic Roles:* Container and containee

* *Topic Types:* State, country and city

With the knowledge of these cornerstones, we can get into _Onotoa_

=== Into Onotoa ===

After creating a new model and a new diagram we are ready start with the real work. First of all we generate our three topic types "state", "country" and "city" 
(to simplify matters, there is no need for additional details like subject identifiers, occurrences, scopes and so on).

In the *Model View* section we right click on *TopicType->Create TopicType...* and choose "state" as name for our new topic type. We handle "country" and "city" in equal measure.
