== How to Create a Schema based on a natural description ==

=== Theoretical background === 

This tutorial is about the creation of a topic maps schema based on a natural description. In this case _natural_ means spoken word
or text by men about a real life "thing", its relationships, (inter)acting objects, players and so on. 

Lets think about the following statement:

_"A company is an institution, where many different persons work. These persons have got a name (first and given name) and an address. 
They may change the company they working for, so an employment is a time relative contract with a beginning and an end. One company 
differ from another by name and address."_

When we analyze this short statement, we can figure out our two main topics "person" and "company". Both got a name and an address (occurrences). There 
are three associations those describe the relationships between them:

* "works for" (time relative -> scope)
* "lives in"
* "located in"

We recognise that more than one person could work for a company, but one person could not work for more than one company. That point 
effects the cardinality. In equal measure we handle the other cardinalities: 

[width="50%", cols="^30%,^30%,^40%"]
|===========================================
|Association| Role One| Role Two
|work for| employee [1..*]| employer [1..1]
|lives in| inhabitant [1..*]| place [1..1]
|located in| locatee [1..1]| location [1..1]
|===========================================

At this point, the occurrence "address" does not contains many informations, because only one value per occurrence is allowed. 
If we want to specify the address, we must transform it into a own Topic Type with its own occurrences. These are:

* street
* street number
* postal code
* city 

Now we are able to associate them to the topics "person" and "company" without the lost of detailed information and can get into _Onotoa_.


=== Into Onotoa ===

First of all, we have to create an new model and a new diagram. Click on *File->New* and choose your preferred name for the model. I have chosen _example_domain.ono_. To create a new diagram, right click on *Diagram* in the *Model View* and choose *Create New Diagram...* in the context menu.
After your decision for a diagram name (_example_domain_ for example), the _Onotoa_ window should looks like this:  

.Onotoa 
[[dom_create_model_diagram]]
image::images/documentation/description_to_schema/create_model_diagram.png[scaledwidth="100%"]

We start with the creation of the topics "company" and "person". On the left side of the _Onotoa_ window you can see a box, 
the so called *Palette*. You can add anything in this box by drag and drop into the diagram. Press and hold left mouse button 
on *Topic Types*, move the cursor into the diagram and release the button and a yellow box will appear. At the bottom of the window 
is the "Property Details View". There you can modify the properties of a topic. We need to change the name, 
because "default0" is not correct. So name the new topic "person". As next step, we create the topic "company" in equal measure.

.Set topic name
[[dom_set_topic_name]]
image::images/documentation/description_to_schema/set_topic_name.png[scaledwidth="100%"]

TIP: Press and hold the left mouse button to move elements in the diagram for visual purposes.

Now we turn to the deeper details of "person". We specified, that a person works in a company, has got at least one first name, 
exact one given name and an address.

The *Model View* is on the left side of the editor window. To create an occurrence click right on *OccurrenceTypes* and choose 
the *Create OccurrenceType...* entry. A pop up appears and we type "first name" as name.

.Create an occurrence
[[dom_create_occurrence]]
image::images/documentation/description_to_schema/create_occurrence.png[scaledwidth="50%"]  

To add this occurrence to the "person" topic click once on the *Occurrence Constraints* entry in the *Palette* and twice on the topic 
in the diagram. In its property page we have to choose a type. Click on the *...* button at the right and select the currently created 
"fist name" occurrence.

We specified, that a person have got between one and infinite first names. We realize this by the change of the cardinality in the 
property page. The incorrect default values for *cardMin* and *cardMax* are zero and infinite. Set *cardMax* to 1. 

.Set occurrence cardinality
[[dom_set_occurrence_cardinality]]
image::images/documentation/description_to_schema/set_occurrence_cardinality.png[scaledwidth="100%"]  

In the end our "fist name" occurrence need a data type. Switch to the *Occurrence Type* tab in the "Property Details View" an scroll 
down to the *Datatype* entry and press the *...* button at the right. Select "xsd:string" in the following dialogue and confirm your decision. 
The first occurrence is finished. 

.Select data type
[[dom_select_datatype]]
image::images/documentation/description_to_schema/select_datatype.png[scaledwidth="50%"]  

NOTE: You can specify valid names by the use of regular expressions

After this is done we repeat this procedure to create the "given name" occurrence for "person" and the "name" occurrence" for "company". 
But set the cardinality in this two cases to "1..1", because this is exactly we want it to be.

A person works for a company. To figure this out, we create the association "works for". Drag an drop an new *Association Constraint* from the 
*Palette* into the diagram. A circle with the label _No type set" will appear. So far we have not created an Association Type but could do this now.
Click on *Type* at the left side in the property menu, choose "works for" as name in the appearing window and our new Association Type will be 
generated.   

.Create association type
[[dom_create_association_type]]
image::images/documentation/description_to_schema/create_association_type.png[scaledwidth="100%"] 

An association demands for roles and these are "employer" and "employee". We search for the *roles* entry in the tap *Association Type* in the 
"Property Details View". There we create a new one by clicking on the *New...* button. Choose "employer" as name an repeat the whole
procedure for "employee". More than one person could work for a company, so we change the employees *cardMax* value from 1 to *.

.Create Roles
[[dom_create_roles]]
image::images/documentation/description_to_schema/create_roles.png[scaledwidth="100%"]

As next step we add this relationship to the diagram. Choose *Topic Role Constraint* in the *Palette*, click once on "person" and twice one the 
association. Repeat this for the "company" and two thin black lines should be added to the diagram. As we see there are no roles entries. 
We change this by clicking on the _no role_type_set_ label in the diagram an select of course "employee" for "person" and "employer" for 
"company" in the property page. 

At this point, there is a incorrect value. According to the diagram, only one person could work for the company. So we must change the 
player cardinality. Click on the "1..1" entry near "person" and set it to "1..*" in the *Property Detail View*. 

.Diagram view
[[dom_diagram_view_1]]
image::images/documentation/description_to_schema/diagram_view_1.png[scaledwidth="100%"]

Of course an employment is a time relative relation and we want to integrate this in our schema. Click once on *Scope Constraint* in the *Palette* and 
click twice on the "works for" association in the diagram. Choose "time" as name. Set the cardinality to "1..1", because we want exact one scope. 
No we have created a new topic, but we need two occurrences to specify the scope: "start" and "end". Right click on the "time" topic in the *Model View* and choose the the *Create Occurrence Constraint...* entry in the context menu. 
In this way create two occurrence constraints. 

.Model view
[[dom_model_view]]
image::images/documentation/description_to_schema/model_view.png[scaledwidth="50%"]

Of course both of them need a Topic Type. Click on *Type* in the property page and create one named "start" and and one named "end". 
As data type, we select "xsd:date" (*Occurrence Type -> Datatype*) and set both cardinalities to "1..1".

.Diagram view
[[dom_diagram_view_2]]
image::images/documentation/description_to_schema/diagram_view_2.png[scaledwidth="100%"]

Now the relationship between "company" and "person" is finished. But there is something we miss in both topics: The address. Lets proceed
with this.

Add a new Topic Type by drag and drop from the *Palette* and name it "address". This topic has got four occurrences: 

* "street"
* "street number"
* "postal code"
* "city"  

Create them in the common way. All of them are needed only once, that is why we set *cardMin* and *cardMax* to 1. As data type we choose "xsd:string".
If you have done all right, the graphical representation of the topic should looks like these:

.Address Topic Type
[[dom_address]]
image::images/documentation/description_to_schema/address.png[scaledwidth="50%"]

Now the last thing to do is the association between "company" respectively "person" and "address". A person lives anywhere and an object 
like a company is located anywhere. So build the two associations types "located in" and "lives in" in your preferred way. I do this by the use of 
context menu in the "Model View". After this I add two Association Constraints from the *Palette* to the diagram and allocate the just created Association Types to them.

To create the roles for the associations take once more a look at the "Property Details View", click on the *Association Type* tap, build the new ones in the usual way and change 
their cardinality: 

[width="55%", cols="^30%,^30%,^40%"]
|===========================================
|Association|Role One|Role Two
|lives in|inhabitant [1..*]|place [1..1]
|located in|locatee [1..1]|location [1..1]
|===========================================
After this, your _Onotoa_ window should looks like these and we completed the tutorial:
