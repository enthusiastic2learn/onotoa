== How to Use the Domain Diagram ==

=== Theoretical background === 

The objective of domain diagrams is the fast creation of Topic Maps schemas and the clearly arranged presentation of these. As red line 
for these tutorial we choose the following example:

_A person has got at name and a homepage. These person is the member of a unique named society. This society has got a 
homepage too and a statue._

Through the analyse of these example we figure out the following topics:

* *Topic Types:* "person" and "society"

* *Association Type:* "member of"

* *Topic Roles:* "member" and "organisation"

* *Occurrence Types:* "homepage" and "statue"

* *Name Constraints:* "name"

After we create the whole schema, we will use the copy and move function to change between the different diagram types. That is 
all we need. Let us get into _Onotoa_.

=== Into Onotoa ===

==== Creating a schema in the Domain Diagram ==== 

First of all, we have to create an new model and a new diagram. Click on *File->New* and choose your preferred name for the model,
e.g. "example_domain.ono". To create a new Domain Diagram, right click on *Diagram* in the *Model View* and choose 
*Create New Domain Diagram...* in the context menu. After your decision for a diagram name  
the _Onotoa_ window should looks like this:

.Onotoa 
[[dd_create_model_diagram]]

Now we create the topic "person". At the right hand side of the editor window you find the *Palette*. Add per drag and drop a new topic to 
the diagram. Press and hold left mouse button on *Topic*, move the cursor into the the diagram and release the button. A yellow box 
named "default0" will appears. Click on the topic to get the focus and click on the name to enter the editor modus to change 
this value. Type "person" and confirm this by pressing the enter key. Repeat this to create the "society" topic type.

.Set Topic name 
[[dd_set_topic_name]]

NOTE: All properties of a topic are also editable in the *Property Details View*, even more than in the Domain Diagram. We do not use it for 
demonstrative reasons in this tutorial. Because of this, we do not set cardinalities, select data types for occurrences and so on.    

A person should have one name constraint. We add these by the use of the context menu. Right click on the topic and chose 
*Add Name Constraint*. A new entry named "name0" will appear in the box. Click on it to get the focus and click twice to change 
the entry to "name".  

.New Name Constraint
[[dd_name_constraint]]

The topic "society" also needs a name constraint (in our example the same one), but this time we add it per drag and drop from the *Palette*. 
Press and hold left mouse button on *Name*, move the cursor into the the topic "society" and release the button. We just created the 
Topic Type "name". Because of this, is is not necessary to re-create this one. Right click on the constraint and click on *Set Name->name* to 
chose the existing one. The name created with the constraint will be deleted automatically.

All our topics still need are some occurrences. Add them per drag and drop or by the use of the context menu(*Add Occurrence Constraint*). 
Enter "homepage" and "statue" as their names.
 
Afterwards your _Onotoa_ window should looks like this:

.Onotoa
[[dd_onotoa_screen_1]]
image::images/documentation/domain_diagram/onotoa_screen_1.png[scaledwidth="100%"] 

The next step will be the creation of the "member of" association. Add an association per drag and drop from the *Palette* to the 
diagram and a blue big dot will appear labelled "association0". The according association type will be generated automatically. Click on 
the dot to get the focus and click on the name to edit it. Type "member of" and press the enter key to acknowledge your decision. 

The entry *Player* in the *Palette* represents the Player Association Constraint. We need this to connect topics and associations. Select the 
*Player" entry from the *Palette*. Now click first on the topic "person" and twice on the "member of" association". A thin black line appears to 
show the connection. Repeat this for the "society" topic.
  
.Create association
[[dd_create_association]]

If we look at the association labels in the diagram, we will see three question marks instead of roles, because we did not 
create them until now. Let us do this next. Click right on *person as ???* to open the context menu, proceed with *Set Role -> 
New Role...* and type "member" as name in the appearing window. Repeat this for the player "society" but name the role "organization".

.Create Role Type
[[dd_create_role_type]]

At this point, we finished the complete schema and created an abstract model of the tutorial example. To improve the diagrams 
clearness we add a picture for each Topic Type. Use the topics context menu, click on *Add Image...* and select an image from your 
hard disk. 

.Diagram view

==== Switching between diagrams ==== 

Sometimes it will be necessary to switch between the different diagram types for various reasons. _Onotoa_ allows you to move and copy 
the complete schema or only parts of this. These operations are lossless and easy to do.

First of all we have to create an normal diagram additional to the existing Domain Diagram. Use the context menu in the *Model View* 
to create a new one named "example_diagram" ) and a new tap will appear in the editor window. 

.Create a second Diagram
[[dd_second_diagram]]
image::images/documentation/domain_diagram/second_diagram.png[scaledwidth="50%"]

To copy the the whole diagram we have to mark all topics in the diagram. Select the *Marquee* entry in the *Palette* and mark all 
topics with a frame or press otherwise the key combination *Ctrl + A* and a fat black line should surround every selected part of the 
diagram.        

NOTE: Of course it is also possible to move and copy single elements or selections.      

Access the context menu of one element (for example the topic "person"), click on *Copy To...->example_diagram* and all should be done. 

.Move elements
[[dd_move_elements]]

Take a look at the normal diagram where the complete schema of this tutorial should appears. You can see all informations we create 
in the last view minutes. We see also that the values for data types and cardinalities are the default values, because we did not set 
them before in the Domain Diagram. 

.Diagram

NOTE: The position of the diagram elements could varies after the move / copy operation.
