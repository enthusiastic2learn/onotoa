== How to Use the Domain Diagram ==

=== Theoretical background === 

The objective of the Domain Diagrams is the fast creation of Topic Maps schemata and the clearly arranged presentation of these. As red line 
for these tutorial we choose the following example:

_A person has got at least one name and a homepage. These person is the member of a unique named society. This society has got a 
homepage too and a statue._

Through the analyze of these example we figure out the following topics:

* *Topic Types:* "person" and "society"

* *Association Type:* "member of"

* *Topic Roles:* "member" and "organization"

* *Occurrence Types:* "homepage" and "statue"

* *Name Constraints:* "name"

After we create the whole schema, we will use the copy and move function to change between the different diagram types. That is 
all we need. Let us get into _Onotoa_.

=== Into Onotoa ===

First of all, we have to create an new model and a new diagram. Click on *File->New* and choose your preferred name for the model. 
I have chosen _example_domain.ono_. To create a new Domain Diagram, right click on *Diagram* in the *Model View* and choose 
*Create New Domain Diagram...* in the context menu. After your decision for a diagram name (_example_domain_ for example), 
the _Onotoa_ window should looks like this:

.Onotoa 
[[dd_create_model_diagram]]

Now we create the topic "person". At the right hand side of the editor window you find the *Palette*. Add per drag and drop a new Topic to 
the diagram. A yellow box named _default0_ will appear. Click on the name to get the focus to change this value, type "person" and affirm the 
name by pressing the enter key. You can change the name ( and all other properties ) alternatively in the *Property Details View* at the bottom. 
Try this way by the creation of the "society" topic.

.Set Topic name 
[[dd_set_topic_name]]

A person should have one Name Constraint called "name". We add these by the use of the context menu. Right click on 
the topic and chose *Add Name Constraint*. Now we have to specify the the type. Search the *Type* button in the *Property Details view* 
and click on it. Type "name" in the name field of the appearing dialogue and click on the *Finish* button. 

.New Name Constraints

In our example a person has got a least one name. To fulfil this condition the change of the cardinality is necessary. In the property 
page of the Name Constraint are two values named *cardMin* and *cardMax*. The default values are zero and infinity. Click into the 
*cardMin* field and change the value to "1".

The topic "society" also needs a Name Constraint, but this time we add it per drag and drop from the *Palette*. Press and hold left 
mouse button on *Name*, move the cursor into the the topic "society" and release the button. We just created the Topic Type "name" and 
so this is not necessary this time. Click on the *...* button to the right of the type field and select "name" in the pop up dialogue. 
Set the same values for the cardinality as for the topic "person". 

.Set cardinality
[[dd_set_cardinality]]

Add the occurrences per drag and drop or by the use of the context menu in equal measure (create "homepage and statue" as types). Additionally 
occurrences demands for a data type. Click on the tab *Occurrence Type* in the property page and look out for the data type entry, where 
you can specify each one. To simplify matters we chose "xsd:string" for both occurrences and use the default cardinalities.

.Select data type
[[dd_select_data_type]]
image::images/documentation/domain_diagram/select_data_type.png[scaledwidth="50%"] 

At this point of the tutorial we create the two Topic Types "person" and "society", add the Name Constraint "name" and the two Occurrence 
Constraints. Your _Onotoa_ window should looks like this one:

.Select data type
[[dd_onotoa_screen_1]]

The next step will be the creation of the "member of" association. Add an Association Constraint per drag and drop from the *Palette* 
to the diagram, create a new type in the *Property Details View* (click on *Type* at the left hand side) and name it "member of". A blue 
dot appears at the screen. Now we connect each topic with the association. At fist, click on *Topic Role Constraint* in the *Palette*, then on the 
association and finally one of the two topics. A thin black line will connect them. Repeat this steps for the other Topic Type. 

TIP: Press and hold the left mouse button to move elements in the diagram for visual purposes.

If we look at the labels in the diagram, we will see three interrogaten marks instead of roles, because we did not create them until now. 
Let us do this next. Click right on "player isa ???" to open the context menu, proceed with *Set Role -> New Role...* and type "member" as name
in the appearing window. Repeat this for the player "society" but name the role "organization".
