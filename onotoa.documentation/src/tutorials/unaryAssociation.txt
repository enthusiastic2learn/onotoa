== How to create unary associations ==

=== Theoretical background ===  

An unary association is an association that needs only one role to be complete. Some examples are:

* person is a single
* person is a friend
* something is usefull

We pick up the first example an create the according schema. We need a Topic Type "person", a Association 
Type "is single" and its only role "single". That is all we need and now we are ready for _Onotoa_.

=== Into Onotoa ===
  
First of all, we have to create an new model and a new diagram. Click on *File->New* and choose your preferred name for the model. I have chosen _example_unaryAsso.ono_. To create a new diagram, right click on *Diagram* in the *Model View* and choose *Create New Diagram...* in the context menu.
After your decision for a diagram name (_example_unaryAsso_ for example), the _Onotoa_ window should looks like this:  

.Onotoa

A the right side next do the editor window is the so called *Palette*. With its help we can add topics the the 
schema. Left click on *Topic Type* and left click twice anywhere in the editor to add our new topic. A 
yellow box with the label "default" should appear. The label represents the name of the topic and we have 
to change it. This and all other properties of every topic is editable in the *Property Details View* at 
the bottom of the _Onotoa_ window. The first entry should be the name. Click in the field and change the name 
from "default" to "person".

NOTE:  Click on a topic to get its focus and its unique property page will be available in the *Property Details 
View*.

Now we will create the association. Use the *Palette* to add an Association Constraint and look at its property 
page. We have to select or create the type of the constraint. Click on the blue label *Type* and a dialogue to create 
an Association Type will appear. Type "is single" as name and press the *Finish* button to create the type.

An association needs roles and we have to define them. In this case it is only one. Click on the graphical representation 
of the association to reach their property page. Click on the tab "Association Type" scroll down to the *roles* entry.
At the right hand side is the *New...* button the create roles. Click on it and type "single" as name in the following 
dialogue. The new role will appear in the property page. But we have to change the cardinality. In our schema one instance from 
the type person could be a single or not so our association is (in our abstract schema only) like a boolean. Change the value of 
*cardMin* to zero. 


.Create Role Type

At the next step we will connect the "person" and "is single. We do this by the use of the Topic Role Constraint. 
Select it from the *Palette* and click first on the topic and second on the association (order does not matter).
From now on a thin black line connect the two topics.

The label "no role type set" means what its look like. Let us set it. Therefore click on the label to get to the property page.
At the right hand side is a small arrow. If you click on it, you will see a list of all available roles and have to 
choose one. In this case the choice should be easy. We are done.
