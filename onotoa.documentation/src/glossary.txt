Association Constraint::
	A association constraint is used to connect an association type with his roles to topic types, which are players.

Association Type::
	An association type is specialized topic type. Only instances of an association type should be used to type an association.

Cardinality::
	The cardinality specifies the amount of the usage of an element. With _cardMin_ is defined how often at least the the
	element must occur. _CardMax_ defines the maximum of the usage of the element.

Constraint::
	A constraint is a topic which represents a definition of a specific topic type. The topic name constraint for instance is used to
	define, that a topic has names of a specific type. The topic constraint may have some occurrences, which specify additional 
	restrictions, for instance the cardinality.

Diagram::
	A diagram is a view of the Topic Maps schema. It consists of graphical representation of schema elements
	and connects them if they have a relationship, e.g. the supertype-subtype relationship.

Model::
	The set of schema and diagram elements is called the model.

Model View::
	The Model View shows all elements of the Topic Maps schema in a tree viewer. It also
	lists the diagrams. 
	
Name Constraint::
	A topic may have a number of names of different types. By using name constraints the number of names and their type
	may be specified for a topic type. All instances of that topic type need to fulfill this constraint.

Name Type::
	A name type is specialized topic type. Only instances of a name type should be used to type a name.
	
Node::
	A node is an element in the tree of the *Model View*. It has a label, mostly the name of the
	schema element it represents and may have child elements.

Occurrence Constraint::
	A topic may have a number of occurrences of different types. By using occurrence constraints the number of occurrences and their type
	may be specified for a topic type. All instances of that topic type need to fulfill this constraint.

Occurrence Type::
	An occurrence type is specialized topic type. Only instances of an occurrence type should be used to type an occurrence.

Role Constraint::
	A role constraint specifies, which role type and cardinality belongs to an association type. This means any association of that type must
	have a number of roles within the range specified in the constraints cardinality. 	

Role Type::
	A role type is specialized topic type. Only instances of a role type should be used as roles of association.
	
Subject Identifier Constraint::
	The subject identifier constraints specifies the number of identifier a topic type may have. It also has a property which defines the 
	syntax of the identifier using a regular expression.
	
Subject Locator Constraint::
	The subject locator constraints specifies the number of locator a topic type may have. It also has a property which defines the 
	syntax of the locator using a regular expression.

TMCL::
	The Topic Maps Constraint Language is the specification of the schema language for Topic Maps. See http://www.isotopicmaps.org/tmcl for
	more information.
		
TMDM::
	The Topic Maps Data Model is the specification of the standard Topic Maps. See http://www.isotopicmaps.org/sam/sam-model/ for
	more information.
	
		
Topic Maps Schema::
	A Topic Maps Schema is a description of the form of a topic map. It consists of topic type and 
	constraints.
	
Topic Maps Schema Element::
	As Topic Maps schema element a part of the schema is meant. This may be any constraint or topic type (and its specializations).

Topic Role Constraint::
	A topic role constraint specifies which topic type is the player of an association of a specific association type. It also says
	which role it plays. Additionally this constraint specifies the number of players playing the role.  
	
Topic Type::
	A topic type is a topic which is used in a type-instance relationship. Types are defined in a Topic Maps schema
	and the instances are created in the topic map.
