|Occurrence Type| Creates an occurrence type element
|Role Type| Creates a role type element
|Association Type| Creates an association type element in the diagram

||
|Occurrence Constraint| Creates an occurrence constraint element to an topic type element.
|Name Constraint| Creates a name constraint element to an topic type element.
|Scope Constraint| Creates a scope constraint element to an name, occurrence or association constraint element. This is only possible if the parent constraint does not use a default type. 
|Reifier Constraint| Creates a reifier constraint element to an name, occurrence or association constraint element. Again this is only possible if the parent constraint does not use a default type. 
|Subject Identifier Constraint| Creates a subject identifier constraint element to an topic type element.
|Subject Locator Constraint| Creates a subject locator constraint element to an topic type element.
|Is A...|Creates a connection between two topic types, which represents a type instance relationship.
|Kind Of...|Creates a connection betweeen two topic types, which represents a kind of relationship.
|Association Constraint|Creates an element representing an association constraint in the diagram. This is used as connection point between topic types which are in an relationship.
|Topic Role Contraint|The connection between a topic type (the player) an an association constraint (the association). 
|=========================== 

NOTE: Not every element is a diagram element. For example, to create a new occurrence constraint you need an existing topic type and drop the palette entry in
this topic type.
