The elements of the palette are:

* *Select:* Tool for selecting diagram elements

* *Marquee:* Selection tool for multiple diagram elements

* *Comment:* Creates a non-TMCL comment in the diagram 

* *Topic:* Creates a topic element in the diagram

* *Topic Type:* Creates a topic type element in the diagram

* *Occurrence Type:* Creates an occurrence type element

* *Role Type:* Creates a role type element

* *Association Type:* Creates an association type element in the diagram

* *Name Type:* Creates a name type element in the diagram

* *Occurrence Constraint:* Creates an occurrence constraint element to an topic type element.

* *Name Constraint:* Creates a name constraint element to an topic type element.

* *Scope Constraint:* Creates a scope constraint element to an name, occurrence or association constraint element. This is only possible if the parent constraint does not use a default type. 

* *Reifier Constraint:* Creates a reifier constraint element to an name, occurrence or association constraint element. Again this is only possible if the parent constraint does not use a default type. 

* *Subject Identifier Constraint:* Creates a subject identifier constraint element to an topic type element.

* *Subject Locator Constraint:* Creates a subject locator constraint element to an topic type element.

* *Is A...:* Creates a connection between two topic types, which represents a type instance relationship.

* *Kind Of...:* Creates a connection between two topic types, which represents a kind of relationship.

* *Association Constraint:* Creates an element representing an association constraint in the diagram. This is used as connection point between topic types which are in an relationship.

* *Topic Role Constraint:* The connection between a topic type (the player) an an association constraint (the association). 

To create a new 'Topic Type' just drag the *Topic Type* palette entry in the diagram. A new 'Topic Type' with a default name was created. 
To add  a new 'Topic Type' repeat.

Adding a 'Name Constraint' to the 'Topic Type' just drag the *Name Constraint* over the 'Topic Type' and a new 'Name Constraint' with 
default properties will be added to the 'Topic Type'. The other constraint work similar, only 'Scope Constraint' and 'Reifier Constraint'
need a scopeable or reifyable constraint as parent. These are 'Association, Name' and 'Occurrence Constraints'.

To create an 'Is a' or 'Kind of' relationship, click on the tool entry in the palette. After that click on a topic type representation and 
after that on another one. In an 'Is a' relationship, the first 'Topic Type' is the instance and the second one is the type. In a 'Kind of'
relationship the first 'Topic Type' is the subtype and the second one is the supertype.
The editing state remains in the relationship creation mode, which means you can create more than one relationship without selecting the 
palette entry. To go back to selection mode press the right mouse button or select 'Select' in the palette.
