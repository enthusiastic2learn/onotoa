=== Exporting Diagrams ===

It is possible to export a diagram as png or svg image. To do this use the 
button labelled "Export Diagram".
After pressing the button, a file dialog is opened. Choose the file or enter a 
new filename and save the file.
The fileformat is chosen by the file suffix. If your name end with '.svg' a svg 
is created, a png else. If the filename
does not end with '.png' it will be added.

The button is connected to the current diagram editor, this means the diagram 
in the current editor is exported.
With no editor open, the button is hidden.
