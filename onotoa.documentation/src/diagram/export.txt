=== Exporting Diagrams ===

It is possible to export a diagram as png or svg image. To do so use the 
button labelled "Export Diagram".
After pressing the button, a file dialogue will open. Choose the file or enter a 
new filename and save the file.
The fileformat is chosen by the file suffix. If your name end with '.svg' a svg 
is created, a png else. Ths suffix '.png' will be added if no suffix is chosen.
