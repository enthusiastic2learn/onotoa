== Export an schema ==

After creating the schema with _Onotoa_ you might use it to validate a topic map. For that you need a schema 
according to the TMCL standard. _Onotoa_ provides an export mechanism to create such schema topic map.

To export a schema use the menu *File->Export...*. A dialog will appear and a list of export wizards are 
proposed. If you use _Onotoa_ in an eclipse installation you will see a lot of wizards. In the standalone
version you should see a dialog like in <<export_dialog>>.

A TMCL schema is a topic map and therefor different notations for the serialisation are possible. You can choose between CTM or XTM.
The following dialog will ask for the filename and if the schema information should be exported too. The schema information are 
associations which connect every schema element with a topic representing the schema.

After pressing finish the topic map is created from the schema and serielised in the given file.

NOTE: If you choose CTM the TMCL templates will be used to create the topic map.
