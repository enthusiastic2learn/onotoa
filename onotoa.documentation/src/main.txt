Preface
=======

Starting as graduate at the Topic Maps Lab, Onotoa has grown to
a usable TMCL schema editor. This document explains the different
functions of Onotoa including some technical background and a
description of the implementation of the GTM level 1 proposal.

Onotoa is based on the popular eclipse platform, which enable it
to be easy extendible. Their usage and the creation of
additional extensions is explained in this document too.
