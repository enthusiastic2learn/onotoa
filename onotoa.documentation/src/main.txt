Preface
=======
//////////////////
TODO: The Preface must be extended. It must explain what Onotoa is, who is the target group and 
why someone should use the editor.

Furthermore we need an outline of the whole handbook in the preface.
/////////////////

Starting as graduate at the Topic Maps Lab, Onotoa has grown to
a usable TMCL schema editor. This document explains the different
functions of Onotoa including some technical background and a
description of the implementation of the GTM level 1 proposal.

Onotoa is based on the popular eclipse platform, which enable it
to be easy extendible. Their usage and the creation of
additional extensions is explained in this document too.
