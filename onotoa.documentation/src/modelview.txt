== The Model View ==

The *Model View* is the core of Onotoa. It represents the schema, visualizing it as a tree. The state of the
schema is saved as attribute of the *ModelView*. The diagram editors are just views on the model, or parts 
if only a few elements of the schema are visualized in a diagram. This makes it possible to create multiple diagrams
to realize different views of the same schema.

With the *Model View* it is possible to create almost every schema element, by using the context menu of the different nodes. 
Analog to the creation of diagrams, new topic types can be created in the *Model View*.For instance to create a new topic type,
just select 'TopicTypes' in the *Model View* and choose 'Create Topic Type...'. A new wizard will open, where the name of the type, 
a subject identifier or a subject locator can be entered.

Right now _Onotoa_ only supports one name per Topic. When the topic is used to type a constraint, the name is visualized therefor _Onotoa_ 
forbids topics with the same name. If a base locator for the Topic Maps schema is set, a subject locator is related using this base locator
and the name of the topic type. Another tool to create subject identifiers is presented later.

By selecting the different elements in the *Model View*, an input mask is activated in the *Property Details View* which is explained in the
following section.

NOTE: Using the context menu to create a constraint, creates a new constraint with default properties. To 
change the properties use the *Property Details View*.
