== The Model View ==

The *Model View* is the core of Onotoa. It represents the schema, visualizing it as a tree. The state of the
schema is saved as attribute of the *ModelView*. The diagram editors are just views on the model, or parts 
if only a few elements of the schema are visulized in a diagram. This makes it possible to create multiple diagrams
to realize different views of the same schema.

With the *Model View* it is possible to create almost ervery schema element, by using the context menu of the different nodes. 
Analog to the creation of diagramms, new topic types can be created in the *Model View*.For instance to create a new topic type,
just select 'TopicTypes' in the *Model View* and choose 'Create Topic Type...'. A new wizard will open, where the name of the type, 
a subject identifier or a subject locator can be entered.

Right now _Onotoa_ only supports one name per Topic. When the topic is used to type a constraint, the name is visualized therefor _Onotoa_ 
forbids topics with the same name. The field for entering the subject identifier provides an assisting facility. By pressing CTRL-Space
a few proposals for a subject identifier will be produced. These proposals are based on:

* the result of a query to Subj3ct, using the name as query
* the prefixes of already used subject identifiers
* if a base locator of the Topic Maps schema is set, a subject identifier is created using this base locator and the name
