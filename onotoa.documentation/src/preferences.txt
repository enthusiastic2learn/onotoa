== Preferences ==

NOTE: If you are using _Onotoa_ within an eclipse installation, you might only want to read <<_identifier_assists>> and <<_diagram_colours>> 

_Onotoa_ provides a preference dialog, which will be explained now. To open it just click *Window->Preferences...* in the menu bar.

As you can see, the preference dialog is split in to parts. On the left side is a tree, where you can see the categories and their subcategories of the preferences.
On the right,  the preferences of the current selected category will be shown. 
Besides the category *Onotoa* is a category labelled *Install/Update*. This category is used to configure the update mechanism of Onotoa.

=== Install/Update ===

The *Install/Update* node has to subcategories, which can be seen after expanding the node. The first node is the *Automatic Updates* node. Click on it
and you'll see the preferences for automatic updates on the right, like in <<automatic_update>>.

If you want to deactivate the automatic update, just uncheck the Button labelled *Automatically find new updates and notify me*.
In the group *Update schedule* you can tell _Onotoa_ when to look for updates. The following section, called *Download options* let you
specify when to download the new plug-ins. In the last group you can tell when to be notified.

The second page, shown in <<update_site>> shows a list of update site _Onotoa_ uses. With the help of the buttons it is possible to add new update sites, edit or
remove existing ones. You also can disable update site, which means, when looking for updates or new installable plug-ins, this site will be ignored.

=== Identifier Assists ===

_Onotoa_ provides a content assistant for subject identifier. This assistant creates proposals for topics based on the name or on the already used
identifier in the topic map schema. The proposals are calculated by so-called PSIProvider. You can create you own provider or install provider from 
other sources. If you don't want to use a specific PSIProvider, for instance the Subj3ct Provider, because of an slow or non existing internet connection,
you can deactivate it by uncheck the checkbox next to the name. Check it again, and the PSIProvider is activated again.

=== Diagram colours ===

The colours of a diagram can be changed in _Onotoa_. THis might coming handy if the default colour scheme doesn't look good, for instance on a beamer.

_Onotoa_ supports colour scheme. A colour scheme is one setting of colours for topic types and comments. Additionally a secondary colour and the font colour
can be set. 

A list of schemes is shown, when you select *Diagram Colors* in the category tree (see <<colour_scheme_list>>).

To select a scheme, use the check box left of the name of the scheme. To create a new one press the *Add...* button and the colour scheme editor will open
(see <<colour_scheme_dialog>>). Enter a name of the scheme and choose the colours, by pressing the buttons next to the label.
If you want to use gradients, like the default colour, check the *Use Gradient* button and choose a secondary colour for the topic type and comment representation.
The gradient will go from the primary colour on the top to the secondary colour at the bottom.

It is possible to export your colour scheme list and import it to another installation of _Onotoa_. 


WARNING: If you import colour schemes, all schemes already installed are deleted.
