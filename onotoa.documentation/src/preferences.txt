== Preferences ==

NOTE: If you are using _Onotoa_ within an eclipse installation, you only 
need to read <<_identifier_assists>> and <<_diagram_colours>> 

_Onotoa_ provides a preference dialogue, which will be explained in this 
section. To open it just click *Window->Preferences...* in the menu bar.

The preference dialogue is split into two parts. On the left is 
a tree with the categories and their subcategories of the 
preferences.
On the right,  the preferences of the current selected category will be shown. 
Next to *Onotoa* is a category called *Install/Update*. This 
category is used to configure the update mechanism of _Onotoa_.

=== Install/Update ===

The *Install/Update* node has two subcategories, which can be viewed after 
expanding the node. The first node is the *Automatic Updates* node. Click on it
and you'll see the preferences for automatic updates on the right, as in 
<<automatic_update>>.

If you want to deactivate the automatic update, just uncheck the button 
labelled *Automatically find new updates and notify me*.
You can instruct _Onotoa_ to look for updates  in the menu *Update schedule*. 
The following section, called *Download options* assists
to configure the download of updates. In the last group you can  give 
instructions for notification.

The second page, shown in <<update_site>> shows a list of update sites used by
_Onotoa_. With the buttons it is possible to add new update 
sites, edit or remove existing ones. You also can disable update sites, which 
means, when looking for updates or new installable plug-ins, this site will be 
ignored.

=== Identifier Assists ===

_Onotoa_ provides a content assistant for subject identifiers. This assistant 
creates proposals for topics based on the name or on the 
identifiers in the topic map schema. The proposals are prepared by so-called 
PSIProvider. You can create you own provider or install providers from 
other sources. If you don't want to use a specific PSIProvider, for instance 
the Subj3ct Provider, because of a slow or non existent internet connection,
you can deactivate it by uncheck the checkbox next to the name. Check it again, 
and the PSIProvider is activated again.

=== Diagram colours ===

The colours of a diagram can be changed in _Onotoa_. This might be useful if 
the default colour scheme doesn't look good, for instance on a beamer.

_Onotoa_ supports colour schemes. A colour scheme is one setting of colours for 
topic types and comments. Additionally a secondary colour and the font colour
can be set. 

A list of schemes is shown in *Diagram Colors* in the category 
tree (see <<colour_scheme_list>>).
 
.Preferences for colour Schemes
[[colour_scheme_list]]

Use the check box left of the name of the scheme to select a scheme. Press the 
*Add...* button to create a new one and the colour scheme editor will open
(see <<colour_scheme_dialog>>). Enter a name of the scheme and choose the 
colours, by pressing the buttons next to the label.
If you want to use gradients, such as the default colour, check the 
*Use Gradient* 
button and choose a secondary colour for the topic type and comment 
representations.
The gradient will go from the primary colour on the top to the secondary colour 
at the bottom.

It is possible to export your colour scheme list and import it to another 
installation of _Onotoa_. 


WARNING: If you import colour schemes, all existing schemes deleted.
