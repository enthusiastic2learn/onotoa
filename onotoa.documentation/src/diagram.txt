== The Diagram Editor ==

The diagram editor is used to visually create and modify Topic Maps schemas. It provides a graphical view of the schema elements.
The visualization is based on the GTM level 1 proposal (see http://isotopicmaps.org/gtm/gtm-oslo-2008-04.pdf ).
The following sections will explain how to create schema elements and how these are repesented.

The following table lists the elements and a short description of their functionality.
