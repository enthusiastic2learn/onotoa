=== Association Type ===

An association type is used to define a type for an association, for instance "worksFor". Using a topic which is not instance
of an association type is invalid.

In addition an association type is related to a set of role types. These define which roles may be used when an association of
this type is created. 

Like names and occurrences association may be reified and scoped.

A association type inherits the properties  of topic type (see <<_topic_type>>).
In addition it has the following properties.

* *roles:* Which roles are accepted by association with the selected type are defined in the
association type. A role constraint has 3 properties: The role type and the minimum and maximum occurrences.
To add a role constraint press *Add...* if the role type is already in the topic map schema and select it
in the appearing dialog. To create a new role type press the *New...* and fill out the appearing
dialog. The cardinality of this constraint can be modified in the table.   

* *reifier:* It is possible to define which topic may reifier names using the current type. Check the 
button *constrained*, which indicates you want explicitly constraint the reification, and choose in the selection box below if the constraint forbids 
reifying (*cannot*), allows reifying (*may*) or needs reifying (*must*). If refying is allowed
a type is needed, which defines the type of the reifier. If the type is not needed, just use 
"tmdm:subject" as type. 
  
* *scope:* With the scope constraint is defined, which scoping types may be used for names using this 'Name Type'.
The scope constraint, as we see later consists of 3 properties: the scoping type, the minimum occurrence (*cardMin*)
and the maximum occurrence (*cardMax*). To add a scope constraint to the type, press *Add* and select the scope types
which may be used as scope. The cardinality values can be changed in the table. To remove a constraint, select 
it in the table and afterwards press *Remove*. If you need to create a new scoping type, just press *New...*. The 
wizard to create a topic type appears and after filling out the wizard, a new constraint will created using the new type.

NOTE: If you create a new topic type for a scope constraint or role constraint it won't be removed if you remove the constraint.
