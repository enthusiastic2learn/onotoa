=== Association Type ===

An association type is used to define the type of an association, for instance "worksFor". A topic which is not instance
of an association type is invalid.

In addition an association type is related to a set of role types. These define the roles to be used when an association of
this type is created. 

Similar to names and occurrences, associations may be reified and scoped.

The properties of topic type are inherited by association type(see <<_topic_type>>).
In addition it has the following properties:

* *roles:* The association type defines the assigned role with the selected type A role constraint 
has 3 properties: The role type and the minimum and maximum occurrences.
To add a role constraint press *Add...* and select the desired role from
in the prompted dialogue. To create a new role type press the *New...* and fill out the prompted
dialogue. The cardinality of this constraint can be modified in the table.   

* *reifier:* It is possible to define which topic may reify associations using the current type. Check the 
button *constrained*, which indicates that you want to constrain the reification explicitly, and choose if the constraint restricts 
reifying (*cannot*), allows reifying (*may*) or needs reifying (*must*) in the selection box below. If reifying is allowed
a type is needed, which defines the type of the reifier. If the type is not needed, just use 
"tmdm:subject" as type. 
   
* *scope:* The scope constraint is defines the scoping types to be used for this association type.
The scope constraint, as we will see later, consists of 3 properties: the scoping type, the minimum occurrence (*cardMin*)
and the maximum occurrence (*cardMax*). To add a scope constraint to the type, press *Add* and select the desired scope types. 
The cardinality values can be changed in the table. To remove a constraint, select 
it in the table and then press *Remove*. If you need to create a new scoping type, just press *New...*. The 
wizard to create a topic type will appear and after filling out the wizard, a new constraint will be created using the new type.

NOTE: If you create a new topic type for a scope constraint or role constraint it won't be removed if you remove the constraint.
