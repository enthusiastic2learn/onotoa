=== Association Type ===

A 'Association Type' inherits the properties  of 'Topic Type' (see <<topictype_pp, 'Topic Type' properties>>).
In addition it has the following properties.

* *roles:* Which roles are accepted by association with the selected type are defined in the
'Association Type'. A role constraint has 3 properties: The 'Role Type' and the minimum and maximum occurrences.
To add a role constraint press `Add...` if the role type is already in the 'TopicMapSchema' and select it
in the appearing dialog. To create a new 'Role Type' press the `New...` and fill out the appearing
dialog. The cardinality of this constraint can be modified in the table.   

* *reifier:* It is possible to define which topic may reifier names using the current type. Check the 
button `has reifier constraint` and choose in the selection box below if the constraint forbids 
reifying (`cannot`), allows reifying (`may`) or needs reifying (`must`). If refying is allowed
a type is needed, which defines the type of the reifier. If the type is not needed, just use 
`tmdm:subject` as type. 
  
* *scope:* With the scope constraint is defined, which scoping types may be used for names using this 'Name Type'.
The scope constraint, as we see later consists of 3 properties: the scoping type, the minimum occurrence (`cardMin`)
and the maximum occurrence (`cardMax`). To add a 'Scope Constraint' to the type, press `Add` and select the 'Scope Types'
which may be used as scope. The cardinality values can be changed in the table. To remove a constraint, select 
it in the table and afterwards press `Remove`. If you need to create a new scoping type, just press `New...`. The 
wizard to create a 'Topic Type' appears and after filling out the wqizard, a new constraint will created using the new type.

NOTE: If you create a new 'Topic Type' for a 'Scope Constraint' or 'Role Constraint' it won't be removed if you remove the constraint.
