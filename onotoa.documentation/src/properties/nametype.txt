=== Name Type ===

A 'Name Type' is used to specify which topics may be used to type a name. In a topic map, a topic may have more than one names.
Their meaning is realized by using topics, for instance the topic 'firstname'. These topics should be typed with name type.
The TMCL standard says, that any type of a name which is not instance of 'name-type' is invalid.

Names can be reified, which means a topic is used to add more information to the name, like who gave it, what does it mean and so on.
The topic which may reify names using this name-type can be specified in the reifier property.

It is also possible to add a scope to names of topics. With the *scope* property you can tell which topics may be used as scope and how often.

A 'Name Type' inherits the properties  of 'Topic Type' (see <<_topic_type, 'Topic Type' properties>>).
In addition it has the following properties.

* *reg. exp:* This regular expression is used to define the syntax of the content of the name. 

* *reifier:* It is possible to define which topic may reifier names using the current type. Check the 
button `constrained`, which indicates you want explicitly constraint the reification, and choose in the selection box below if the constraint forbids 
reifying (`cannot`), allows reifying (`may`) or needs reifying (`must`). If refying is allowed
a type is needed, which defines the type of the reifier. If the type is not needed, just use 
`tmdm:subject` as type. 
  
* *scope:* With the scope constraint is defined, which scoping types may be used for names using this 'Name Type'.
The scope constraint, as we see later consists of 3 properties: the scoping type, the minimum occurrence (`cardMin`)
and the maximum occurrence (`cardMax`). To add a 'Scope Constraint' to the type, press `Add` and select the 'Scope Types'
which may be used as scope. The cardinality values can be changed in the table. To remove a constraint, select 
it in the table and afterwards press `Remove`. If you need to create a new scoping type, just press `New...`. The 
wizard to create a 'Topic Type' appears and after filling out the wqizard, a new constraint will created using the new type.

NOTE: If you create a new 'Topic Type' for a 'Scope Constraint' it won't be removed if you remove the 'Scope Constraint'.
