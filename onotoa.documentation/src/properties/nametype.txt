=== Name Type ===

A name type is used to specify the topics to type a name. In a topic map, a topic may have more than one names.
Their meaning is realized by using topics, for instance the topic "firstname". These topics should be typed by a name type.
The TMCL standard says, that any type of a name which is not instance of "name-type" is invalid.

Names can be reified, which means a topic is used to add more information to the name, such as its origin, its meaning and so on.
The topic which may reify names using this name type can be specified in the reifier property.

It is also possible to add a scope to names of topics. With the *scope* property you can tell which topics may be used as scope and how often.

The properties  of topic type are inherited by a name type(see <<_topic_type>>).
In addition it has the following properties:

* *reg. exp:* This regular expression is used to define the syntax of the content of the name. 

* *reifier:* It is possible to define which topic may reify names using the current type. Check the 
button *constrained*, which indicates that you want to constrain the reification explicitly, and choose if the constraint restricts 
reifying (*cannot*), allows reifying (*may*) or needs reifying (*must*) in the selection box below. If reifying is allowed
a type is needed, which defines the type of the reifier. If the type is not needed, just use 
"tmdm:subject" as type. 
  
* *scope:* The scope constraint is defines the scoping types to be used for this name type.
The scope constraint, as we will see later, consists of 3 properties: the scoping type, the minimum occurrence (*cardMin*)
and the maximum occurrence (*cardMax*). To add a scope constraint to the type, press *Add* and select the desired scope types. 
The cardinality values can be changed in the table. To remove a constraint, select 
it in the table and then press *Remove*. If you need to create a new scoping type, just press *New...*. The 
wizard to create a topic type will appear and after filling out the wizard, a new constraint will be created using the new type.

NOTE: If you remove the scope constraint, its topic types will continue to exist.
