=== Prefix ===

A Prefix is used to shorten a IRI used in subject identifier or subject locator. Imagine all subject identifier start with:
http://onotoa.topicmapslab.de/example/topics/. A topic for person could have the subject identifier http://onotoa.topicmapslab.de/example/topics/person.
Anoter topic has the subject identifier http://onotoa.topicmapslab.de/example/topics/corporation.

Specifying a prefix like 'ex' for http://onotoa.topicmapslab.de/example the identifier could be: ex:person and ex:corporation.
These are the same like the long versions. Another advantage is, if you want to change the prefixing URL you have to do it only once, in the
prefix definition, instead of ever topic you used the prefixing URL.

Every diagram presents a box containing the prefixes. By pressing on the prefix box in the upper left corner of the diagram, the prefix property page is shown.
