=== Prefix ===

A prefix is used to abbreviate a IRI used in subject identifiers or subject locators. Let us suppose that all subject identifiers start with:
"http://onotoa.topicmapslab.de/example/topics/". A topic for a person could have the subject identifier "http://onotoa.topicmapslab.de/example/topics/person".
Another topic has the subject identifier \'http://onotoa.topicmapslab.de/example/topics/corporation'.

A prefix such as "ex" could be used for "http://onotoa.topicmapslab.de/example" to denote identifiers like: "ex:person" and "ex:corporation".
They are equivalent to like the long versions, but if you want to change the prefix of a URL it only has to be done once in the
prefix definition not for each individual topic.

Every diagram includes a box containing the prefixes. If you click on the prefix box in the upper left corner of the diagram, the prefix property page will open.

To remove a prefix, just select and press image:images/documentation/search/buttons/remove.png[] in the table.
Press image:images/documentation/search/buttons/new.png[] to add a new prefix and a dialogue will be shown, which provides an input mask for the prefix.
After pressing *OK* the new prefix will be added to the schema and will exported if the CTM export is applied.
