=== Topic Type ===

Topic type is a topic, which specifies that a topic, which is instance of topic type is used as type
in a type-instance relationship. A schema defines topic types, their names and occurrences and their relationship. Every type
in a schema is instance of topic type, despite types which are used as names, roles or occurrence type.

Every type in TMCL is instance of topic-type, which means they all share a minimum of properties. The property page of
a topic type can be seen in <<tt_pp>>:

A topic type has the following properties:

* *name:* The name of the topic type. Although the TMDM permits having different Topics with the same name, _Onotoa_ forbids that. 
The name of the type is also unscoped  and of type "tmdm:default-name".

* *subject identifier:* The subject identifier are a set of IRI. The list of the identifier can be modified by pressing the button labelled *...* 
and use the subject identifier dialog. This list may be empty.

* *subject locator:* Similar to subject identifiers contains a topic type a list of IRIs representing the subject locators of the topic. 
This list can be edited by using the dialog opened by pressing the button labelled *...*. It looks like the subject identifier dialog. 
The list may be empty too.

* *is a:* This property is a list of topic types which type the current topic. In the diagram view this is represented by a connection 
between the topics. The property  page renders a comma separated list of names of the typing topics. To add or remove the topic, press the button labelled 
*...* and a dialog opens. On the left side is a list of topic types which are not used as type, on the right is the list of types used. 
With the help of the buttons in the middle it is possible to move a type to the other side.

* *kind of:* This is a list of topics which are super types of the current topic type. Editing this list is similar to the *is a* property.

* *overlap:* In TMCL topics are defined as types, which are used as types for instances in a topic map. Per default, a topic may not be type
of two topic types at the same time, for instance a topic should no be of type "Person" and "Car". To explicitly allow this, the overlap
property is used. It contains a list of topic types like is a or kind of. Edited is the list with the same dialog like is a. The list 
contains all topic types which may be used in an type-instance relationship. For instance to allow a topic to be type of "Car" and "Person"
just add "Car" to the overlap property of "Person". _Onotoa_ automatically adds "Person" to the overlap property of "Car".

* *is abstract:* A topic type may be used as type or supertype. To forbid that the topic type may be used as type, check the is abstract button,
which sets this property to true. This means the topic type may be used as supertype in a supertype-subtype relationship, but not as type in
a type-instance relationship.

* *reifies:* The refies property defines a constraint if the topic type can, must or cannot be used as type for reifiers. Additionally it is possible
to set a type which may be reified by this type. Is non set "tmdm:subject" is used, which indicates any type. To create a reifier constraint,
activate the check box labelled *constrained* and choose the kind of constraint in the combo box below. You can choose from: *cannot*, which means 
this type must not used as type for reifiers, *may* which means it may be used as reifier type and *must* which means it has to be a type for
reifiers. If you allow the topic type to be a type for reifier, you can select from existing topic types to specify which type is refiable by
topics of this type.
