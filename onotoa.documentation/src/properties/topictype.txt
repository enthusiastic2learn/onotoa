=== Topic Type ===

Topic type is a topic, which specifies that a topic, which is instance of topic type is used as type
in a type-instance relationship. A schema defines topic types, their names and occurrences and their relationship. Every type
in a schema is instance of the topic "topic-type", except for types which are used as name, role or occurrence type.

Every type in TMCL is instance of "topic-type", which means they all share a minimum of properties. The property page of
a topic type can be seen in <<tt_pp>>:

A topic type has the following properties:

* *name:* The name of the topic type. Although the TMDM permits having different Topics with the same name, _Onotoa_ forbids that. 
The name of the type is also not scoped  and of type "tmdm:default-name".

* *subject identifier:* The subject identifiers are a set of IRI. The list of the identifiers can be modified by pressing the button labelled *...* 
and in the subject identifier dialogue. This list may be empty.

* *subject locator:* The subject locators are a set of IRIs representing the subject locators of the topic, which is similar to the subject identifiers. 
This list can be edited by using the dialogue opened by the button *...*. It looks like the subject identifier dialogue. 
The list may be empty too.

* *is a:* This property is a list of topic types, which are the type of the current topic. In the diagram view this is represented by a connection 
between the topics. The property  page includes a  list of names of the typing topics, separated by commas. To add or remove a topic, press the button labelled 
*...* and a dialogue will open. On the left hand side is a list of topic types which are not used as type, on the right hand side is a list of the types in use. 
The centrally located buttons can be used to move a type from one side to the other.

* *kind of:* This is a list of topics which are supertypes of the current topic type. Editing this list is similar to the *is a* property.

* *overlap:* Topics in TMCL are defined as types, which are used as types for instances in a topic map. By default, a topic may not be 
of two types at the same time, for instance a topic should no be of type "Person" and "Car". To  overcome this restriction the overlap
property is used. It contains a list of topic types like *is a* or *kind of*. The list is edited with the same dialogue as *is a*. The list 
contains all topic types which may be used in a type-instance relationship. For instance to allow a topic to be typed by "Car" and "Person"
just add "Car" to the overlap property of "Person". _Onotoa_ automatically adds "Person" to the overlap property of "Car".

* *is abstract:* A topic type may be used as type or supertype. To prevent that the topic type is used as type, check the *is abstract* button,
which sets this property to true. This means the topic type may be used as supertype in a supertype-subtype relationship, but not as type in
a type-instance relationship.

* *reifies:* The refies property is a constraint and defines if the topic type may or must be used as reifier for a topic type. The table consists of
three columns. The first one specifies the type, i.e. which instances may be reified by instances of the current topic type. The *cardMin* value is either
'0' or '1', so is the value of *cardMax* in the third column. If both cardinality values are '0', the current topic type must not be used as reifier for the
topic type. If both values are '1' the current topic type has to be a reifier for the type. If *cardMin* is '0' and *cardMax* is '1' the use of the current topic
type as reifier for the type is optional. You can create a new topic reifies constraint using the buttons *Add...* and *New...*. The first one opens
a selection dialogue where you can choose the types to be reified. The latter is used to create a constraint using a new topic type. After pressing
this button, the new topic type dialogue is opened and after filling out the text fields a new constraint is created using this type. By default the cardinality
is set to optional use. You can edit them directly in the table. Click on the value that you want to change and edit the value.
