:ac: Association Constraint

An association constraint is used as connection between an association type and it's role player constraints.


The '{ac}' has only one property:

* *Type:* The  association type which is constrained in use. 

You can select an existing 'Association Type' by
pressing the right button and selecting the desired type. To create a new type, click on the `Type` label on the left. 
The wizard to create a new type will appear and after the creation the new type will be the type of the constraint.

NOTE: There is no such thing as an association constraint in the TMCL draft. It was introduced to encapsulate the association type
and the constraints using this type.
