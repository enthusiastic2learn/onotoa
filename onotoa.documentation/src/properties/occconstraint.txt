=== Occurrence Constraint ===

An occurrence constraint is used to connect a topic type with an occurrence type. For instance the topic "document" has to have at least one occurrence of
type "content". This constraint will have a cardMin of 1 and a cardMax of *.


An occurrence constraint is an element of a topic type. 
It has the following properties:

* *type:* An occurrence type used for the constraint. If the type is not set, the default 
type "tmdm:subject"  will be used, which means the occurrence may be of any type.
* *cardMin:* The minimum number of names with the given type. The default is 0.
* *cardMax:* The maximum number of names with the given type. The default is *, which means infinity.

After creating a new occurrence constraint the type is set to the default type "tmdm:subject". This can be changed
by pressing the button on the right hand side. A dialogue appears proposing all occurrence types in the schema. To 
create a new occurrence type press the label *Type:* on the left of the text field. This will open the New Type Wizard. After the creation 
it will be selected as type for this constraint.

If a special type is set it will be possible to edit his properties in the second tab, called 'Occurrence Type'. It lists
all type properties, see <<_occurrence_type>> for details.

NOTE: Although "tmdm:subject" is set in the namespace of TMDM, it is specified in the TMCL standard. This type just means
every topic is allowed.
