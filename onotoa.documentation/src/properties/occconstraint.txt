=== Occurrence Constraint ===

A 'Occurrence Constraint' is an element of an 'Topic Type'. 
It has the following properties:

* *type:* A 'Occurrence Type' which is used for the constraint. If the type is not set, the default 
type `tmdm:subject`  is used.
* *cardMin:* The minimum number of names with the given type.
* *cardMax:* The maximum number of names with the given type.

After creating a new 'Occurrence Constraint' the type is set to the default type `tmdm:subject`. This can be changed
by pressing the button on the right site. A dialog appears, which proposes all 'Occurrence Types' in the schema. To 
create a new 'Occurrence Type' press the label *Type:* at the left of the text field. This opens the New Type Wizard. After 
creating the type it is selected as type for this constraint.

If a special type is set it is possible to edit his porperties in the second tab, labeld *Occurrence Type*. It lists
all type properties, see <<_occurrence_type, Occurrence Type>> for details.

If a constraint is added to a type, it says: A topic of that type needs at least *cardMin* and at most *cardMax*
occurrences of the given type.

NOTE: Although `tmdm:subject` is set in the TMDM namespace, it is spedified in the TMCL standard. This type just means
every topic is allowed.
