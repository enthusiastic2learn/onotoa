=== Role Combination Constraint ===

:rcc: role combination constraint

The {rcc} is used to constraint the possible variations of players and roles.

For instance given three topic types "city", "state" and "continent" and an association type "contains". We know, that if a state contains a specific, 
the continent containing this state will also contain the city. So we don't want to have the explicit relationship "continent" contains "city". With the role 
combination constraint we can specify that if the role "container" in the association "contains" is played by "continent", the role "containee" may only 
be played by "state". 

In _Onotoa_ you would say: The role type is "container" and the topic type is "continent". The other role is "containee" and the other topic type is
"state".  

The {rcc} is a property of association type, so you can find it as additional tab in the association type property page.

The properties of the {rcc} are:

* *Role Type* The first of the two roles.

* *Topic Type* The player with the role given in role type.

* *Other Role* The second role, i.e. the player dependent on the first player/role combination.

* *Other Topic Type* The player with the role given in 'Other Role' depending on the first role/player combination.
