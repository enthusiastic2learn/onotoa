:rcc: Role Combination Constraint

The '{rcc}' is used to constraint the possible variations of players and role.

For instance given three topic types "city", "state" and "continent" and an association type "contains". We know, that if a state conatins a specific, 
the continent containing this state also contains the city. So we don't want to have explicitly a relationship "continent" contains "city". With the role 
combination constraint we can specify that if the role "container" in the association "contains" is played by "continent", the role "containee" may only 
be played by "state". 

In _Onotoa_ you would say: The 'Role Type' is "container" and the 'Topic Type' is "continent". The 'Other Role' is "containee" and the 'Other Topic Type' is
"state".  

The '{rcc}' is a property of 'Association Type' so you can find it an additional tab in the 'Association Type' property page.

The properties of the '{rcc}' are:

* *Role Type* The first of the two roles.

* *Topic Type* The player which plays the role given in 'Role Type'.

* *Other Role* The second role, which player is dependent of the first player/role combination.

* *Other Topic Type* The player which may play the role given in 'Other Role' depending on the first role/player combination.
