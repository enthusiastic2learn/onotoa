=== Occurrence Type ===

An occurrence type is used to specify the topics to type an occurrence. In a topic map, a topic may have more than one occurrence.
Their meaning is realized by using topics, for instance the topic "content" in a topic "document". These topics should be typed with occurrence type.
The TMCL standard says, that any type of an occurrence which is not instance of "occurrence-type" is invalid.

Occurrence types can be reified and scoped similar to name types.

The properties of a topic type are inherited by an occurence type (see <<_topic_type>>).
In addition it has the following properties:

* *unique:* If this is *true* the TMCL validator will check if the value of occurrences of this type is unique in 
the topic map. This means two topics with occurrences of this type may not have the same value. The unique constraint is
activated by selecting the check box.   Otherwise this property is false.

* *datatype:* It is possible to set the datatype of the occurrence value. You can enter your own 
type definition URI, but it is preferable to use the XML schema datatypes. 
These can be chosen from the dialogue opened by the button labelled *...*.
If no datatype is set, "xsd:anyType" will be used, which means every content will be valid.

* *reg. exp:* This regular expression is used to define the syntax of the content of the occurrence. 

* *reifier:* It is possible to define which topic may reify occurrences using the current type. Check the 
button *constrained*, which indicates that you want to constrain the reification explicitly, and choose if the constraint restricts 
reifying (*cannot*), allows reifying (*may*) or needs reifying (*must*) in the selection box below. If reifying is allowed
a type is needed, which defines the type of the reifier. If the type is not needed, just use 
"tmdm:subject" as type. 
   
* *scope:* The scope constraint is defines the scoping types to be used for this occurrence type.
The scope constraint, as we will see later, consists of 3 properties: the scoping type, the minimum occurrence (*cardMin*)
and the maximum occurrence (*cardMax*). To add a scope constraint to the type, press image:images/select_icon.png[] and select the desired scope types. 
The cardinality values can be changed in the table. To remove a constraint, select 
it in the table and then press image:images/documentation/search/buttons/remove.png[]. If you need to create a new scoping type, just press image:images/documentation/search/buttons/new.png[]. The 
wizard to create a topic type will appear and after filling out the wizard, a new constraint will be created using the new type.

NOTE: If you remove the scope constraint its topic types will continue to exist.
