=== Occurrence Type ===

An occurrence type is used to specify which topics may be used to type an occurrence. In a topic map, a topic may have more than one occurrences.
Their meaning is realized by using topics, for instance the topic 'content' in a topic 'document'. These topics should be typed with occurrence type.
The TMCL standard says, that any type of an occurrence which is not instance of 'occurrence-type' is invalid.

Like name types 'Occurrence Types' can be reified and scoped.

A occurrence type inherits the properties  of topic type (see <<_topic_type>>).
In addition it has the following properties.

* *unique:* If this is *true* the TMCL validator will check if the value of occurrences of this type is unqie in 
the topic map. This means two topics with occurrences of this type may not have the same value. The unique constraint is
activated by selecting the check box. Per default this property is false.

* *datatype:* It is possible to set the datatype of the occurrence value. Although it is possible to enter your own 
type definition URI it is advised to use the XML schema datatypes. These are selectable by the dialog opened with the button labelled *...*.
If no datatype is set, "xsd:anyType" is used, which means every content is valid.

* *reg. exp:* This regular expression is used to define the form of the content of the name. 

* *reifier:* It is possible to define which topic may reifier names using the current type. Check the 
button *constrained*, which indicates you want explicitly constraint the reification, and choose in the selection box below if the constraint forbids 
reifying (*cannot*), allows reifying (*may*) or needs reifying (*must*). If reifying is allowed
a type is needed, which defines the type of the reifier. If the type is not needed, just use 
"tmdm:subject" as type. 
  
* *scope:* With the scope constraint is defined, which scoping types may be used for names using this name type.
The scope constraint, as we see later consists of 3 properties: the scoping type, the minimum occurrence (*cardMin*)
and the maximum occurrence (*cardMax*). To add a scope constraint to the type, press *Add* and select the 'Scope Types'
which may be used as scope. The cardinality values can be changed in the table. To remove a constraint, select 
it in the table and afterwards press *Remove*. If you need to create a new scoping type, just press *New...*. The 
wizard to create a topic type appears and after filling out the wizard, a new constraint will created using the new type.

NOTE: If you create a new topic type for a scope constraint it won't be removed if you remove the scope constraint.
