=== Diagram and Topic Map Schema ===

A diagram has only one property: its name. This name can be changed in the property page of the selected diagram. 
A diagram is selected in the *Model View* or if you click on an empty place in the opened diagram.
A diagram contains all informations of the graphical represention of the schema elements, which are modified in the 
diagram editor.

Another top level element is the 'TopicMapSchema'. This element contains all the elements of the schema, despite the graphical 
representations. The 'TopicMapSchema' has only two properties: a name and a base locator. Both properties may be unset, but it is
advised to set a base locator for automatic creation of subject identifiers.
