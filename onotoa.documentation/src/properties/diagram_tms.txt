=== Diagram ===

The diagram has only one property:

* *Name:* The name of the diagram. It is a unique identifier in a schema, which means you can not create two diagrams with the same name.

You can edit the name by modifying the value in the textfield in the property page. If you enter a name which is already used, a red icon will appear on the left side,
and the name won't be changed, when the focus is lost.

=== Topic Map Schema ===

Another top level element is the 'TopicMapSchema'. This element contains all the elements of the schema, despite the graphical 
representations. 

The properties of a 'TopicMapSchema' are:
* *Name:* The name of the schema.
* *Base Locator* The base locator, used for automatic subject identifier generation.
