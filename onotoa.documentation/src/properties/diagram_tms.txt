=== Diagram ===

The diagram has only one property:

* *Name:* The name of the diagram. It is a unique identifier in a schema, which means you can not create two diagrams with the same name.

You can edit the name by modifying the value in the text field of the property page. If you enter a name which is already used, a red icon will appear on the left hand side,
and the name will not be changed, when the focus is lost.

* *Name:* The name of the schema.
