=== Name Constraint ===

A name constraint connects a topic type to a name type. For instance you have the topic type "person" and the name type "first name". 
If a name constraint is added to the topic "person" it will be possible to specify that it has to have exactly one name of type "first name".

A name constraint is an element of an topic type. 
It has the following properties:

* *type:* A name type used for the constraint. If the type is not set, the default name type specified in
TMDM will be used. 
* *cardMin:* The minimum number of names with the given type. The default value is 0.
* *cardMax:* The maximum number of names with the given type. The default value is * which means infinity.

After creating a new name constraint the type is set to the default name type "tmdm:default-name". This can be changed
by pressing the button on the right hand side. A dialogue will appear, proposing all name types in the schema. To create a new
name type press the label *Type:* on the left of the text field. This will open the new type wizard. After the creation 
it will be selected as type for this constraint.

If a special type is set it is possible to edit its properties in the second tab, called 'Name Type'. It lists
all type properties, see <<_name_type>> for details.
