=== Name Constraint ===

A 'Name Constraint' is an element of an 'Topic Type'. 
It has the following properties:

* *type:* A 'Name Type' which is used for the constraint. If the type is not set, the default name type specified in
TMDM is used.
* *cardMin:* The minimum number of names with the given type.
* *cardMax:* The maximum number of names with the given type.

After creating a new 'Name Constraint' the type is set to the default name type `tmdm:default-name`. This can be changed
by pressing the button on the right site. A dialog appears, which proposes all 'Name Types' in the schema. To create a new
'Name Type' press the label *Type:* at the left of the text field. This opens the New Type Wizard. After creating the type
it is selected as type for this constraint.

If a special type is set it is possible to edit his porperties in the second tab, labeld *Name Type*. It lists
all type properties, see <<_name_type, Name Type>> for details.

If a constraint is added to a type, it says: A topic of that type needs at least *cardMin* and at most *cardMax*
names of the given type.
