In the table below the text fields, you can edit your word list, assign types to your words, leave
comments and mark single words.

When you have selected one ore more words, two buttons will be enabled:
The *Remove* button will remove the selected words from your list.
The *Create selected types* button will create types only from the selected words.

By clicking *Create types* for every word in the list a type will be created.

The Types you have created of your word list will appear in the *Model View* and can be
used as topic types.

NOTE: Words and the created topic types are not connected. So if you rename a created topic type or modify a word after 
the creation of the topic type it won'r reflect on the counter part.
