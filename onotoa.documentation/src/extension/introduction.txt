== What you need to extend Onotoa ==

_Onotoa_ is based on the Eclipse RCP platform. This platform provides a 
framework to create an application based on modules called bundles. These 
bundles, also called plug-ins are bundled in features. These features can be 
installed in an application based on Eclipse RCP.

The chapters that follow assume you know how to write eclipse plug-ins, features
and update sites. If you don't, please read the eclipse documentation first. 

For more information see the documentation at http://www.eclipse.org.

To develop an _Onotoa_ plug-in an installation of Eclipse IDE (at least version 
3.5) is needed. Please verify that you can create plug-in projects. You can do 
so by creating a new plug-in project using the New...-wizard.

To create a new plug-in for _Onotoa_ you need the _Onotoa_ plug-ins in your target 
platform. The target platform is used to specify a set of plug-ins which may be 
used by plug-in projects created in the current workspace. Usually all plug-ins 
installed in the eclipse instance are in the target platform. The target 
platform can be changed in the preferences.

If we need to add the _Onotoa_ plug-ins to the target platform, there are 
two ways:

* Install the _Onotoa_ features in the eclipse installation using the _Onotoa_ 
update site (http://onotoa.topicmapslab.de/update) and restart eclipse.
* Add the plug-ins folder of an _Onotoa_ installation to the target platform. 
Open the preference page for *Target Platform* and edit the active one.
Then dialog, press add (in the dialogue that follows), select *Directory* and add the path to the 
plug-ins folder of your _Onotoa_ installation.

NOTE: _Onotoa_ 1.1.1 or higher is required.

You will then be set to create the first _Onotoa_ plug-in. The  
extension points of _Onotoa_ will be explained in the following chapters.
