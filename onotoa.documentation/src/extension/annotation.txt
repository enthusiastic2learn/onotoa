== Create a Annotation Keys ==

With _Onotoa_ it is possible to annotate schema elements. These annotations are a pair of key and value. Basically both are strings. It is possible to
create an extension to provide an annotation type. This type defines for a specified key, what datatype it contains. It is also possible to
provide some values to choose from, or proposals, which are used for content assist.
